# Peer Evaluations

Welcome to the C4G BLIS Webpage! Thanks for taking the time to review our project.

Our main objective this semester was to create a create a version of BLIS that can perform periodic updates to a version of BLIS running on a remote server. You can read more about our objectives and current Project Status by checking out [the Home page!](https://c4g-spr22-blis.github.io)


## Peer Review Task #1: Testing BLIS running in a cloud/server setting

Over the past semester, we've been working to deploy a version of BLIS that is capable of running in a cloud/server setting. It is accessible with the followinglink:

We have a short quiz correlating with this assignment, you can find it [here](https://forms.office.com/r/YG4cMaC0rP). Instructions for this peer review task is embedded in the form. Thank you for providing your feedback!


## Peer Review Task #2: Pushing a data dump to a version of BLIS running on a remote server

Testimonies and user feedback from labs in Africa indicate that internet availability is not always guarenteed, so we wanted to create a version of BLIS for Windows that could push data to BLIS for Cloud (or a central BLIS instance) on a periodic basis. This next peer review task involves installing C4G BLIS v3.72, the most current version of BLIS.

!!! warning

    BLIS is a Windows-based program and is most reliably accesible through the Microsoft Windows Operating System. Don't have Microsoft OS? Feel free to follow the set of instructions listed **somewhere we should probably link them to instructions on how to instantiate a Windows VM?**

### Instructions
1. [Navigate to the official C4G BLIS website](http://blis.cc.gatech.edu/download.php)

2. Click on **Download BLIS v3.72 Complete** which will create a standalone version of BLIS v3.72. Extract the zipped file and click on BLIS.exe to start C4G BLIS.
3. TBD!
